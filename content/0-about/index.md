## The Basics 

I'm originally from West Orange, New Jersey but currently live in Southern New Hampshire where I have been building a small homestead on 12.5 acres of land. I work as a Product Manager @ [Andela](https://www.andela.com) and outside of work have a passion for gardening, permaculture, running, hiking, and surfing.

As a teen, I got interested in building software and spent much of my time tinkering and self-teaching. I got interested in hackathons and attended 30+ during my middle school and high-school years - including some of the earliest iterations of MHacks and PennApps - getting to meet amazing technologists from Alexis Ohanian to Stephen Wolfram. In college, I stayed connected with the hackathon scene and was an organizer for HackPrinceton.

At Princeton, I continued learning about technological concepts, but chose a path of study that was a bit more mathematics oriented and concentrated in Operations Research and Financial Engineering [(ORFE)](https://orfe.princeton.edu).
