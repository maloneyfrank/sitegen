<h2>The Basics</h2>
<p>I'm originally from West Orange, New Jersey but currently live in Southern New Hampshire where I have been building a small homestead on 12.5 acres of land. I work as a Product Manager @ <a href="https://www.andela.com">Andela</a> and outside of work have a passion for gardening, permaculture, running, hiking, and surfing. </p>
<h2>A Bias for Building</h2>
<p>As a teen, I got interested in building software and spent much of my time tinkering and self-teaching. I got interested in hackathons and attended 30+ during my middle school and high-school years - including some of the earliest iterations of MHacks and PennApps - getting to meet amazing technologists from Alexis Ohanian to Stephen Wolfram. In college, I stayed connected with the hackathon scene and was an organizer for HackPrinceton.</p>
<p>At Princeton, I continued learning about technological concepts, but chose a path of study that was a bit more mathematics oriented and concentrated in Operations Research and Financial Engineering <a href="https://orfe.princeton.edu">(ORFE)</a>. </p>
<p>During college, I also picked up a passion for gardening and began studying permaculture/regenerative agriculture. I received my Permaculture Design Certificate in 2020 and blended this newfound interest with my college studies through my senior <a href="https://dataspace.princeton.edu/handle/88435/dsp01zs25xc507">thesis.</a></p>
