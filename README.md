# sitegen
[WIP] low-tech static website generator that I am building for personal website and side-projects.

heavily inspired by https://github.com/lowtechmag/solar_v2 and credit is given in each file where source code has been used and/or modified.

### [WIP] Current Ideation:

The general structure of the generated website depends on the config.toml file. The file defines content categories that can be used throughout the project to structure, style, and determine
custom behavior throughout the site. 

For the purpose of the personal site that I am using as a guinea pig, the general content categories are:

- digital-things 
- physical-things
- favorite-things

relationship between the content categories and navigation structure still being determined.
