# sitegen
[WIP] low-tech static website generator that I am building for personal website and side-projects.

### [WIP] Current Ideation:

The general structure of the generated website depends on the config.toml file. The file defines content categories that can be used throughout the project to structure, style, and determine
custom behavior throughout the site. 

Folder structure for the assets and content folders should align with these content categories.
